# Core Workspace Rules

1. **Small Diffs**: Do not change more than 3-4 files per task unless doing a global rename.
2. **Read First**: Before editing a file, always read it. Do not guess imports.
3. **No Churn**: Do not reformat code (prettier/eslint) unless you are editing that specific line.
4. **Docs First**: Update `docs/AGENTS.md` or `docs/REPO_MAP.md` before writing code for complex features.
5. **Verify**: Run `pnpm check` after significant changes.
